## Overview ðŸ“‹

A book recommendation system using Flask and an API is a web-based tool that suggests books to users based on their reading preferences and history. The system is built using the Flask framework, which allows for the creation of web applications in Python.

# Algorithm For Recommendation

The Recommendations are made by computing similarity scores for movies using consine simarity. For each movie tags are created by combining various details like genre of the movie, title, top cast, director and then they are converted to vectors using which similarity matrix is formed. Then for any searched movie the movies with the largest similarity score with it are sorted and then recommended.
